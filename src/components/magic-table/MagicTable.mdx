# MagicTable

Read the overview for the MagicTable at // TODO:

The MagicTable displays a configurable table of properly formatted data. This control is responsible for displaying
the data provided to it, formatted according to the properties provided.  Handlers are provided to handle the user events to respond and manipulate the data provided to the table.

MagicTable will display the latest data passed in as an array of rows to dataRows and format it according to the array of column descriptions passed to the config property.

**Note:**  Each row needs to have a unique value set for the 'id' property.  MagicTable relies on this id to work.

Rows can be selected as batches on which batch actions can be taken.  These batch actions can be specified and displayed when rows are selected.

By adding the TableConfigurationModal component, users can rearrange the columns and change column visibility with a pop-up dialog.

Table search functionality and additional button actions can be added for taking action on the data in the table as a whole, such as exporting or creating a new entry.

Single row actions can be specified and can be displayed in an ellipsis menu or as buttons on the right side of each row.

Filtering and sorting events are supported that can callout to the application for querying filtered and sorted data.

Additional functionality is explained in the properties below.


### <a name="config"></a> Column Configuration

The Column object for defining a configuration is the following.  This configuration is then passed to a hook to convert it
to a format for the MagicTable.

|field|type|default|description|allowed values|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|id|String|
|title|String|
|subTitle|String|
|titleSymbol|String|
|titleSymbolTooltip|String|
|sortable|boolean|false|
|format|String|string| number, currency, checkbox| // TBD
|dataType|String|"String"|
|dragLock|boolean|false|
|editorType|String|null|
|isFilterable|boolean|false|
|defaultVisible|boolean |false|
|requiredForUiState|boolean |false|
|hiddenFromConfigurator|boolean |false|
|alwaysVisible|boolean | false|
|defaultWidth |Integer |200|
|editorProps|EditorProps|null|
|filterType|String |"default"|



In your code, do the following:

```import {useTableFormatters} from '@ppmd-ui/components'````

Call useTableFormatters(events, locale, currency).getConfig(config)on the  config json object shown in the attachment you provided to get the configuration to pass into the config in MagicTable.  The returned myConfig will also enable hover tooltips on truncated values, format the cells properly with currency and locale information provided.

```const myConfig = useTableFormatters(events, locale, currency).getConfig(config)```
Then pass myConfig to the config parameter in MagicTable.

The optional parameters of this call are below.

For events, you can pass in handlers to support editing in the table if needed.

```{onCellChange, onCellBlur, onCellClick, onEnterKey, onLinkClick, getInitialValue }```

The event handlers beginning with “on” provided above will get called with the following.

```(event, column, row.id, row, inputValue, initialValue, format)```

For locale, pass in the locale from your user object.  “en-US” etc.

For currency, pass in the currency from your user object.  “USD”  etc.

## <a name="converting"></a>Differences between carbon ConfigurableTable and react-calmly MagicTable
Take the following into consideration when converting tables from ConfigurableTable to MagicTable.

**allColumnsSortable:**

**columnsWidth:**  Removed, column widths come via config.

**resizeToWindow={true}**   New.  True for table to resize to bottom of browser window. False, use height parameter.

**doResize={handleTableResize}**   New, for resizing the table to the window if desired.

**config={config}**   column widths here are used for initial and updated column widths now.

**dataRows = {data.rows}**    was  data={data.rows}

**totalItems = {data.rows.size}** was total={data.row.size}

**freezeFirstDataColumn={true}**   New, for freezing the first column of data (in addition to selection checkboxes and/or row opening widgets.  Selection checkboxes are now always pinned to the left of the table while scrolling.

***Toolbar changes***

**renderToolbar:** Removed.  Use properties of ConfigurableTableToolbar as properties to MagicTable itself.

**actionToolbar ={ JSX }:** New, replaces renderToolbar. Why, so action toolbar is also covered by the batch action toolbar, components are rendered neater and consistent with the design.

**actions:** New, same as ConfigurableTableToolbar

**batchActions:** New, same as ConfigurableTableToolbar

**searchPlaceholderText={‘Search...'}**  New, same as ConfigurableTableToolbar

**onSearchChange={debouncedHandleSearchChange}**  New, same as ConfigurableTableToolbar

**onAction={onActionsTriggered}**  New, same as ConfigurableTableToolbar

**isEmptyView={false}**  New, same as ConfigurableTableToolbar
